Cars learn to drive around user drawn track by [Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) (NEAT)

Used HTML5 Canvas, and Javascript

Instructions:
* Place the cars to the left of the screen as the fitness of each car is based on its clockwise progress of track
* Draw a track of any shape using the drawTrack button, similar to this

* Run the cars by pressing the play button
* Tweak parameters, such as number of cars, number of sensors, turn type and Enjoy!

## Neural network visualisation
The changes in the "brain" of the best car, or its Neural Network are shown in the bottom right corner of the screen.
The green color and red color represents positive and negative change in weight over the previous best car respectively.
### The inputs:
The distance measured by the sensors

### The outputs:
Turn Left, turn Right or nothing

## Learning
Cars learn using mutations of best car's neural network

## Note:
The cars with ackerman turning will take a longer time to learn if the track is too difficult, for example with many twists and turns
